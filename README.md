# About

Welcome to my Next.js project!

## Overview

This project is built using Next.js, a React framework that enables Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG). The main goal of this project is to create a web application that fetches data from the Fakestore API and displays products dynamically. Here's a breakdown of the key technologies and features used:

- **Next.js**: Used for server-side rendering and static site generation, providing optimized performance and SEO benefits.
  
- **Fakestore API**: Utilized to fetch product data dynamically, simulating an e-commerce store environment.
  
- **Automatic Scrolling**: Implemented a scrolling feature within the "Build" section to showcase products automatically.
  
- **Sorting Data**: Integrated functionality to sort fetched data based on different categories.
  
- **Hero Section**: Designed using components from [Aceternity UI Components](https://ui.aceternity.com/components/) and icons from Heroicons, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience.
  
- **TypeScript (TS)**: Entire project is written in TypeScript, ensuring type safety and improved development workflow.
